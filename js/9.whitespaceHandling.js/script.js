//?Whitespace is any string of text composed only of spaces, tabs or line breaks 
//? These characters allow you to format your code in a way that will make it easily readable by yourself and other people

//!HTML largely ignores whitespace

//?In the case of HTML, whitespace is largely ignored â€” whitespace in between words is treated as a single character, 
//?and whitespace at the start and end of elements and outside elements is ignored.

<h1>    HEllo         world!   </h1>
