//The Document Object Model (DOM) is an API for manipulating DOM trees of HTML and XML documents (among other tree-like documents).

//!What is DOM Tree
//A DOM tree is a tree structure whose nodes represent an HTML or XML document's contents.
//For example:see the structure in assests folder

//The actual dom tree preserves whitespace
//When a web browser parses an HTML document, it builds a DOM tree and then uses it to display the document.

//!what does Document API do
//The Document API, also sometimes called the DOM API, allows you to modify a DOM tree in any way you want.
//It enables you to create any HTML or XML document from scratch or to change any contents of a given HTML or XML document.
//Web page authors can edit the DOM of a document using JavaScript to access the document property of the global object
//This document object implements the Document interface.
